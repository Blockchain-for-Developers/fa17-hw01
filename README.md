# Homework 1
Welcome to the Blockchain for Developers DeCal's first assignment. You'll be familiarizing yourself with *Solidity*, the currently most supported smart contract language. For those familiar with JavaScript, *Solidity* comes with a similar syntax.

## Homework Instructions

For the two exercises, **ex1** and **ex2**, please take a look at the specifications noted in their respective markdowns.

In **greeter_skeleton.sol** you will be coding up the *Solidity* equivalent to `Hello, world!`. In **fibonacci_skeleton.sol** you will be implementing the simple Fibonacci formula learned in CS61A.

For syntactical quirks and more info on the language, please refer to the [*Solidity* documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/).

As you (probably) do not have your developer environment set up, we recommend checking your code in the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). Clicking on `Create` on the bottom-right corner should bring up fields where users can input arguements to specific functions. Clicking on that function's name should run the function and provide an output under the `Decoded:` subtitle.

## Submission Instructions

Please fork this repo and push your code up to your fork. Please fill out this Google form to let us know where you've got your answers: https://goo.gl/forms/3urLz3x3JESPuCHg2.

Please feel free to reach out to the staff via Piazza should you run into any trouble.

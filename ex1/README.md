## Greeter Contract
Build a simple contract that "greets" the user.

As is common when learning any language for the first time, this is the *Solidity* equivalent to `Hello, world!` in other languages.

### Rules
* The contract cannot be payable

### Minimum Requirements
* The contract must print a "greeting" to the console

### Extra Credit
* Keep track of the number of times the contract has sent out a "greeting"
* Have multiple possible greetings
